# YOUR PROJECT NAME

The goal of this project is to create a macro board like a stream deck but with less option, for example I will have some shortcut for easy acces to git commands or open app ...
<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
It will cost 91.76 without all the composants so I will buy it after on JLCS (because it can be assemble and respect the limit of 100$)

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
The thinks who was a little tricky is to understand how a keyboard work and which librairy I should use for the programmation. I guess the thing who help me is the online doc
